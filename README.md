# Ceasar Cipher

## About Ceasar Cipher

In cryptography, a **Caesar Cipher**, also known as **Caesar's Cipher**, the **Shift Cipher**, **Caesar's Code** or **Caesar Shift**, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
